        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre of which is
        a
        22-yard (20-metre; 66-foot) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails (small sticks) balanced
        on
        three stumps. Two players from the batting team, the striker and nonstriker, stand in front of either wicket
        holding
        bats, while one player from the fielding team, the bowler, bowls the ball toward the striker's wicket from the
        opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and then switch places with
        the
        nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each of these exchanges. Runs are also scored when the
        ball
        reaches the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.
